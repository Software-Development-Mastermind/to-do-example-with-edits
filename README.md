## Summary

The To Do application was the next project I chose to build. The goal was to allow a user to type in 
their desired task they wanted to do and have it appear on a list below. The user would also be able
to delete items upon completion or delete tasks that were no longer needed for any reason.

This project helped me to make deeper connections on how the DOM works with all three linked files. The
design I chose lead me to creating and manipulating elements in my JavaScript pretty frequently. The logic 
was unclear at first, but once I got my hands dirty and dove in head first I was capable of figuring out
which functions to use and how to make the application run smoothly.
